# K-NN-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-
Trying to predict whether the person will buy (1) or not buy (0) the car base on the person’s’ data. The aim of this  K-NN (k-nearest neighbours) model (where the number neighbours = 5) is to classify the potential buyer in to two classes as will buy (1) or will not buy (0) the car based on a given dataset of the independent variables (Age and Income).
Here the K-NN algorithm stores all the existing data then classifies a new data point based on the likeness.
